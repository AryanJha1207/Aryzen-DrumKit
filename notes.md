## 💡 Why I Built This

Wanted to combine my interest in music with coding. Thought it would be cool to make something interactive that people could actually play with. Plus, it was a great way to practice JavaScript event handling and CSS animations.

## 🎵 Pro Tip

Try playing actual drum patterns! The keys are laid out like a real drum kit setup.
